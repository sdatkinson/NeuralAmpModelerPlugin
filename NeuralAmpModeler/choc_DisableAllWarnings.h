    Sometimes you inevitably have to include some 3rd-party headers in your
   code, and it's depressing how often even the most widely-used libraries are
   full of poorly-written code that triggers all kinds of compiler warnings.

    Obviously you're a proper programmer who always has warnings turned up to
   full, and "-Werror" enabled, so rather than having to compromise your own
   standards to work around other people's laziness, this header provides an
   easy way to locally disable warnings by sandwiching your 3rd-party headers
   between includes of these two files, e.g:

        #include "SloppilyWrittenButEssentialLibraryCode.h"
        #include "choc_DisableAllWarnings.h"
        #include "choc_ReenableAllWarnings.h"
