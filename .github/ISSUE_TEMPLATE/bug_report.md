**Thanks for taking the time to write a bug report!** Use the following prompts to help you describe what's going on.  The more info you provide, the easier it'll be to understand how to fix it for you without having to come back and ask you questions.

## Before you make a new bug report:
- [ ] Have you searched the Issues to see if your problem has already been reported? If it has, please follow that Issue instead of opening a duplicate!
- [ ] Have you checked the [Rough edges](https://github.com/sdatkinson/NeuralAmpModelerPlugin/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#rough-edges) for help?

## Description
Provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is.

## To reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

 - Standalone, VST3, or AU
 - DAW (if applicable)
 - Audio interface [e.g. Focusrite Scarlett Solo 3rd Gen]
 - Sample rate [e.g. 44.1 kHz]
 - Buffer size [e.g. 256 samples]
 - Provide a model that the bug happens with (_except_ if the bug happens _without_ a model loaded) _Note: Please try using [linear_10.nam](https://github.com/sdatkinson/neural-amp-modeler/blob/8cf2580121f181e751da9b7003fe72195d80955c/tests/resources/models/identity/linear_10.nam) and [wavenet_minimal](https://github.com/sdatkinson/neural-amp-modeler/blob/8cf2580121f181e751da9b7003fe72195d80955c/tests/resources/models/identity/wavenet_minimal.nam) and check whether they work as expected._
 - Provide an IR that the bug happens with (_except_ if the bug happens _without_ an IR loaded)
 - **Does the bug _not_ happen under some other conditions?** If you can find what _one_ thing makes the difference between the bug appearing and not, this _drastically_ improves the chances I can fix it.
