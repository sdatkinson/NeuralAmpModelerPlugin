This is a cleaned up version of [the original iPlug2-based NAM plugin](https://github.com/sdatkinson/iPlug2) with some refactoring to adopt better practices recommended by the developers of iPlug2.
(Thanks [Oli](https://github.com/olilarkin) for your generous suggestions!)

\*could also support VST2, AAX, CLAP, Linux, iOS soon.
